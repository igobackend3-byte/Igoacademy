/**
 * SUCCESS_STORIES — single shared source of truth for the "Student Success"
 * feature (website refinement spec, Section 3.1). Used by HomePage.jsx
 * (homepage teaser grid), StudentSuccessPage.jsx (full list), and
 * StudentProfilePage.jsx (individual profile at /student-success/:slug).
 *
 * Previously this list was duplicated separately in HomePage.jsx and
 * StudentSuccessPage.jsx with a comment saying "kept in sync manually" —
 * moved here (26 Aug 2026) so there's exactly one copy to update and no risk
 * of the two drifting apart, now that a third page (the profile page) also
 * needs the same data.
 *
 * name / role: real IGO Academy trainees now working within the IGO Group
 * itself, provided directly by the Academy Head.
 *
 * roleDescription: a neutral, factual description of what that job role
 * generally involves at IGO Group — written from the role title itself,
 * NOT a personal quote or claim attributed to the individual.
 *
 * testimonial: intentionally `null` for everyone until the Academy Head
 * supplies each person's own words. No first-person quote is ever fabricated
 * and attached to a real named person — StudentProfilePage.jsx shows a
 * "coming soon" placeholder instead of a testimonial when this is null.
 *
 * link / linkLabel: the real IGO Group page for that person's department,
 * verified live on igogroups.in before being added (26 Aug 2026) — shown as
 * a "verify at IGO Group" button on the profile page, not a direct redirect
 * from the card.
